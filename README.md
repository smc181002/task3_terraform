# Launch WordPress and MySQL with Terraform in AWS

This code is modular and used to create a VPC with WordPress in Public Subnet and MySQL on Private Subnet.

There are <b>some changes</b> to be made in the file for the running into code in your account.

- First in the provider you can change the region from ap-south to your region.
- Then change your Key Name in the instances file to key pairs availabe with you.
- You can change the AMI if you want to use any other images.

Hope you found this code useful. Thank you
